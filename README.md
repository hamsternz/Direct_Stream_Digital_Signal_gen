# Direct_Stream_Digital_Signal_gen

Streaming bits to a FPGA pin, to generate a 1kHz test signal using much the same techniques as used on Super Audio CDs.

I was annoyed enough prototyping a Wien Bridge Signal Generator that I decided to see if I make a
better signal source by storing raw sigma-delta bits in a ROM and playing them back.
